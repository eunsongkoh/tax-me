"your grocery sidekick"

taxMe is an app that makes grocery shopping easier. 
Simply add items to your cart as you shop, and the app automatically calculates and applies the correct tax based on the items in your cart. Itâ€™s a simple way to keep track of your purchases and taxes while you shop while staying in budget. 

Due to hosting costs, taxMe won't be going into production (yet)!

## Run Locally

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
